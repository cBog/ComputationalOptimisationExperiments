abstract = {This paper presents a path planner for multiple un- manned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for realistic scenarios. The paths returned by the algorithm fulfill and optimize multiple criteria that 1) are calculated based on the properties of real UAVs, terrains, radars, and missiles and 2) are structured in different levels of priority according to the selected mission. The paths of all the UAVs are obtained with the multiple coordinated agents coevolution EA (MCACEA), which is a general framework that uses an EA per agent (i.e., UAV) that share their optimal solutions to coordinate the evolutions of the EAs populations using cooperation objectives. This planner works offline and online by means of recalculating parts of the original path to avoid unexpected risks while the UAV is flying. Its search space and computation time have been reduced using some special operators in the EAs. The successful results of the paths obtained in multiple scenarios, which are statistically analyzed in the paper, and tested against a simulator that incorporates complex models of the UAVs, radars, and missiles, make us believe that this planner could be used for real-flight missions.},

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithm-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planners have been extensively studied for their effectiveness and flexibility. However, they still suffer from a drawback that the high-quality waypoints in previous candidate paths can hardly be exploited for further evolution, since they regard all the waypoints of a path as an integrated individual. Due to this drawback, the previous planners usually fail when encountering lots of obstacles. In this paper, a new idea of separately evaluating and evolving waypoints is presented to solve this problem. Concretely, the original objective and constraint functions of UAVs path planning are decomposed into a set of new evaluation functions, with which waypoints on a path can be evaluated separately. The new evaluation functions allow waypoints on a path to be evolved separately and, thus, high-quality waypoints can be better exploited. On this basis, the waypoints are encoded in a rotated coordinate system with an external restriction and evolved with JADE, a state-of-the-art variant of the differential evolution algorithm. To test the capabilities of the new planner on planning obstacle-free paths, five scenarios with increasing numbers of obstacles are constructed. Three existing planners and four variants of the proposed planner are compared to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed planner. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed planner and the idea of separate evolution.},

Use of UAV in civilian application has started to become common as technology become more readily available in the civilian arena. Availability and accessibility of advance autonomous technology for civilian has encourages wide range of civilian UAVs been developed. Gathering of data shows that most Civilian used UAV have wing span around 3 meter while its total takeoff weight is less than 6kg. This is important due to the nature of mission in civilian usage which may endanger properties and life forms that includes human. Small size, low speed UAV has relatively small kinetic energy in the event of crashes. This paper will look into the existing civilian UAVs and identify demands that yet to be addressed. In this paper we have identified the design goals to fill in the existing gap while keeping affordability in mind. This paper also dealt with the parameter that will assist in the conceptual design of a slow speed, easy to fly civilian use UAV. Final goal is to build the prototype and demonstrate the capability of such craft completing the predefined mission typical of civilian usage.},

abstract = {A fundamental aspect of autonomous vehicle guidance is planning trajectories. Historically, two fields have contributed to trajectory or motion planning methods: robotics and dynamics and control. The former typically have a stronger focus on computational issues and real-time robot control, while the latter emphasize the dynamic behavior and more specific aspects of trajectory performance. Guidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), including fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, involves significant differences from most traditionally defined mobile and manipulator robots. Qualities characteristic to UAVs include non-trivial dynamics, three-dimensional environments, disturbed operating conditions, and high levels of uncertainty in state knowledge. Otherwise, UAV guidance shares qualities with typical robotic motion planning problems, including partial knowledge of the environment and tasks that can range from basic goal interception, which can be precisely specified, to more general tasks like surveillance and reconnaissance, which are harder to specify. These basic planning problems involve continual interaction with the environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of existing motion planning algorithms while adding perspectives and practical examples from UAV guidance approaches.},

The DE/current-to-{\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater}best is a generalization of the classic ldquoDE/current-to-best,rdquo while the optional archive operation utilizes historical data to provide information of progress direction. Both operations diversify the population and improve the convergence performance. The parameter adaptation automatically updates the control parameters to appropriate values and avoids a user's prior knowledge of the relationship between the parameter settings and the characteristics of optimization problems. It is thus helpful to improve the robustness of the algorithm. Simulation results show that JADE is better than, or at least comparable to, other classic or adaptive DE algorithms, the canonical particle swarm optimization, and other evolutionary algorithms from the literature in terms of convergence performance for a set of 20 benchmark problems. JADE with an external archive shows promising results for relatively high dimensional problems. In addition, it clearly shows that there is no fixed control parameter setting suitable for various problems or even at different optimization stages of a single problem.},

abstract = {Multimodal optimization amounts to finding multiple global and local optima (as opposed to a single solution) of a function, so that the user can have a better knowledge about different optimal solutions in the search space and as and when needed, the current solution may be switched to another suitable one while still maintaining the optimal system performance. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), due to their population-based approaches, are able to detect multiple solutions within a population in a single simulation run and have a clear advantage over the classical optimization techniques, which need multiple restarts and multiple runs in the hope that a different solution may be discovered every run, with no guarantee however. Numerous evolutionary optimization techniques have been developed since late 1970s for locating multiple optima (global or local). These techniques are commonly referred to as "niching" methods. Niching can be incorporated into a standard EA to promote and maintain formation of multiple stable subpopulations within a single population, with an aim to locate multiple globally optimal or suboptimal solutions simultaneously. This article is the first of its kind to present a comprehensive review of the basic concepts related to real-parameter evolutionary multimodal optimization, a survey of the major niching techniques, a detailed account of the adaptation of EAs from diverse paradigms to tackle multimodal problems, benchmark problems and performance measures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Ant colony optimization (ACO) takes inspiration from the foraging behavior of some ant species. These ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. Ant colony optimization exploits a similar mechanism for solving optimization problems. From the early nineties, when the first ant colony optimization algorithm was proposed, ACO attracted the attention of increasing numbers of researchers and many successful applications are now available. Moreover, a substantial corpus of theoretical results is becoming available that provides useful guidelines to researchers and practitioners in further applications of ACO.

In this paper, a new planning space for the virtual globe and the planner is proposed and a common threat model is constructed for threats including a no-fly zone, hazardous weather, radar coverage area, missile killing zone and dynamic threats. Additionally, an improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is developed to enhance route planning efficiency and terrain masking ability. Our route planning methods are optimized on the virtual globe platform for practicability. A route planning system and six types of planners were developed and implemented on the virtual globe platform. Finally, our evaluation results demonstrate that our optimum planner has better performance in terms of fuel consumption, terrain masking, and risk avoidance. Experiments also demonstrate that the method and system described in this paper can be used to perform global route planning and mission operations.},

abstract = {The big number of evolutionary planners for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that have been developed demonstrates the good acceptance that the evolutionary techniques enjoy within the UAV community. However, the minor or nonexistent statistical characterization of the results obtained by the majority of the planners not only makes it difficult to assess their actual performance but also to justify the selection and/or parameterization of their supporting algorithms. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a method for comparing the planners performance by jointly employing several general and problem-specific quality indexes, which take into account the complexity and particularities of the problem. The generality of the performance metrics adopted, which are able to deal with any multi- objective dominance definition, makes them equally applicable to multi-objective planners with different relation operations (such as Pareto dominance, weighted objectives aggrega- tion, and others). The specificity of the other indexes, which consider the types of solutions preferred by the problem experts, makes them especially attractive to characterize their planners' behavior. The paper also shows how to analyze the results of the quality indexes graphically in order to identify, for a particular UAV planning problem, the best planners within a set of 36 variants (based on Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution).},

abstract = {In a search and rescue scenario, an expeditious response is critical since the radius of the search area increases by roughly 3 km per hour while the life expectancy of the lost individual decreases. To find the object of the search as quickly as possible, the incident commander creates an overlay probability map identifying high priority search areas and develops a search plan that allocates search assets to each area to maximize the probability of success. Conventional aerial searches have the ability to cover a large area quickly, but are costly and require highly trained personnel to operate. In this work we present results of a proof of concept Search and Rescue Unmanned Aerial System, ResQuad, that capitalizes on the advances in drone industry while allowing for reduction in cost and retaining the advantages of aerial perspectives. Given the probability map from the search commander and the system constraints, a near optimal path is determined by the Path Planner in our system ensuring the coverage of high probability areas. While the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) follows the path, an on-board computer with a camera processes and collates the data using an anomaly detection algorithm, saving the results to its memory for the base to verify in real-time.},

    abstract = { In the conventional search situation, there are three general features. I The kinematic bases, involving the positions, geometrical configurations, and motions in the searchers and targets, with particular reference to the statistics of their contacts and the probabilities of their reaching various specified relative positions. II The probabilistic behavior of the instrument of detection (eye, radar, sonar, etc) when making a given passage relative to the target. III The over-all result—the probability of contact under general stated conditions, along with the possibility of optimizing the results by improving the methods of directing the search. The present paper is devoted to the first feature, and is intended to provide the kinematic bases of the theory. It studies fairly simple cases of relative motion and draws inspiration from the kinetic theory of matter. The second paper, entitled Target Detection, will deal with the second feature. It is based on the methods of survival probabilities familiar in actuarial studies, and is, it must be emphasized, confined to the case of independent trials. A third paper will deal with an important aspect of the third feature, and will be entitled The Optimum Distribution of Searching Effort. It represents the continuous extension of a paper of a similar title published by the author in Operations Research in February 1953. }

abstract = {“Kinematic bases,” the first paper of this series, discussed the geometric and kinematic factors involved in search—the positions, motions, and contacts of observers and targets. Probability was introduced only in assuming specific relative positions for the observer and target. The present paper discusses the uncertainties inherent in the act of detection under various specific conditions of contact. In the course of the discussion a body of methods for applying probability to problems of detection is developed. It must be emphasized, however, that these methods are conditioned by the particular situation in the case of visual detection because the different elementary acts of looking or “glimpses” are essentially independent trials. The reason for the distinction follows.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Computer-Assisted Search Planning (CASP) system developed for the United States Coast Guard. The CASP in- formation processing methodology is based upon Monte Carlo simulation to obtain an initial probability distribution for target location and to update this distribution to account for drift due to currents and winds. A multiple scenario approach is employed to generate the initial probability distribution. Bayesian updating is used to reflect negative information obtained from unsuccessful search. The principal output of the CASP system is a sequence of probability "maps" which display the current target location probability distributions throughout the time period of interest. CASP also provides guidance for allo- cating search effort based upon optimal search theory.},

SARGIS is mainly consisting of supporting databases, application modules and graphical user interface (GUI). The geographic information, SAR resources, vessel movements and ocean environment databases are established to provide necessary data for SAR incident response operations. The drift prediction module can estimate the temporal-spatial distribution and trajectory of the targets using a Monte-Carlo particle model, in which the tidal current, wind-driven current and leeway are taken into account. The SAR planning module can assist the response commander to determine the searching area, and search patterns, allocate the SAR units. From the data management to the visualization of SAR prediction and decision making results, all the system operations can be directed shown in the well-designed interactive GUI/GIS platform.},

@article{BREIVIK200899,
abstract = {A new operational, ensemble-based search and rescue model for the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea is presented. The stochastic trajectory model computes the net motion of a range of search and rescue objects. A new, robust formulation for the relation between the wind and the motion of the drifting object (termed the leeway of the object) is employed. Empirically derived coefficients for 63 categories of search objects compiled by the US Coast Guard are ingested to estimate the leeway of the drifting objects. A Monte Carlo technique is employed to generate an ensemble that accounts for the uncertainties in forcing fields (wind and current), leeway drift properties, and the initial position of the search object. The ensemble yields an estimate of the time-evolving probability density function of the location of the search object, and its envelope defines the search area. Forcing fields from the operational oceanic and atmospheric forecast system of The Norwegian Meteorological Institute are used as input to the trajectory model. This allows for the first time high-resolution wind and current fields to be used to forecast search areas up to 60 h into the future. A limited set of field exercises show good agreement between model trajectories, search areas, and observed trajectories for life rafts and other search objects. Comparison with older methods shows that search areas expand much more slowly using the new ensemble method with high resolution forcing fields and the new leeway formulation. It is found that going to higher-order stochastic trajectory models will not significantly improve the forecast skill and the rate of expansion of search areas.},

abstract = {We present SARPlan, a geographic decision support system designed to assist the Canadian Forces in the optimal planning of search missions for missing aircraft. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the available search resources are deployed in a way that will maximize the mission's probability of success. The optimization modules are based on search theory, on gradient search methods and on constraint satisfaction programming. We include results that demonstrate that SARPlan improves the performance when compared to the current manual method. This improvement translates to an increase in the chances of finding lost aircraft and survivors, resulting in more saved lives. Another benefit of using SARPlan is a potential decrease in the operations costs. In 2001, SARPlan was the winner of three prestigious excellence awards in the information technology domain.},

@article{Lin2014,
abstract = {During unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) search missions, efficient use of UAV flight time requires flight paths that maximize the probability of finding the desired subject. The probability of detecting the desired subject based on UAV sensor information can vary in different search areas due to environment elements like varying vegetation density or lighting conditions, making it likely that the UAV can only partially detect the subject. This adds another dimension of complexity to the already difficult (NP-Hard) problem of finding an optimal search path. We present a new class of algorithms that account for partial detection in the form of a task difficulty map and produce paths that approximate the payoff of optimal solutions. The algorithms use the mode goodness ratio heuristic that uses a Gaussian mixture model to prioritize search subregions. The algorithms search for effective paths through the parameter space at different levels of resolution. We compare the performance of the new algorithms against two published algorithms (Bourgault's algorithm and LHC-GW-CONV algorithm) in simulated searches with three real search and rescue scenarios, and show that the new algorithms outperform existing algorithms significantly and can yield efficient paths that yield payoffs near the optimal.},

abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) is arguably one of the most powerful stochastic real-parameter optimization algorithms in current use. DE operates through similar computational steps as employed by a standard evolutionary algorithm (EA). However, unlike traditional EAs, the DE-variants perturb the current-generation population members with the scaled differences of randomly selected and distinct population members. Therefore, no separate probability distribution has to be used for generating the offspring. Since its inception in 1995, DE has drawn the attention of many researchers all over the world resulting in a lot of variants of the basic algorithm with improved performance. This paper presents a detailed review of the basic concepts of DE and a survey of its major variants, its application to multiobjective, constrained, large scale, and uncertain optimization problems, and the theoretical studies conducted on DE so far. Also, it provides an overview of the significant engineering applications that have benefited from the powerful nature of DE.},
